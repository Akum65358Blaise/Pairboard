# Pairboard

Development verison of the Pairboard app. This currently has no live hosting or live database.

## Getting started

+ Clone the repo
+ `npm install` in the root folder
+ **AND** `npm install` in the client folder
+ In the config folder, make a copy of config_template.json and rename it config.json
+ `npm start` in the root folder

This will launch client and server concurrently. There is no need to run them in separate terminals.
